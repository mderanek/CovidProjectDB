This is our project for CSE 40793 during the fall semester of 2020. It is an interactive map of campus that tracks Covid cases for each dorm and contains information on other buildings such as academic and restaurants. Simply click on the highlighted areas of the map to bring up a popup of that building's statistics in order to observe which areas may be hotspots.
